There was a young tiger named Lion. Lion wished he had stripes. One day, Lion ventured out to the river and began to speak to some of his friends. Henry the Hippo told Lion that he should go to the striped forest, and maybe he would find it.  Lion searched the striped forest for stripes of his own, but he could not find a stripe of his type.  He found a square lair full of hair, a snake who could bake, and a turtle named Murtle.  Lion wished he was lying, but he could not find the stripes he had envisioned in his mind.
