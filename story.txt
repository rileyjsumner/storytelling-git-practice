There was a young tiger named Lion. Lion wished he had stripes. One day,
 Lion ventured out to the river and began to speak to some of his friends.
 Henry the Hippo told Lion that he should go to the striped forest, and maybe
 he would find it. Lion searched the striped forest for stripes of his own, but he could not find a stripe of his type.  He found a square lair full of hair, a snake who could bake, and a turtle named Murtle.  Lion wished he was lying, but he could not find the stripes he had envisioned in his mind.

The Lion was sad that he didn't find his strips. He went home sad and had no way of feeling happy. He heard of a magic juice that would cure his sadness and so he decided to find it to drink it. And so he started his journey to the pond by the miler light factory in milwaukee.

when the lion made it to the pond he thought to himself, "I'm water is for
suckers." Then he went inot the miller lite facorty and preceded to made a case
throne. Apon his throne he drank and drank then drank some more. Near the end
the lion began to feel dizzy. The miller lite came pouring out of his mouth.
"All my miller lite, what a plight," he cried, "I guess I'm just going to 
have to drink somemore."
